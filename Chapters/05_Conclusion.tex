This thesis is an additional contribution that shows the limitations of Mask R-CNN on a two dimensional plane. Although the framework is proven to be efficient with natural images, segmentation on biological images is still a challenge. Mask R-CNN is sufficient if the object has a consistent shape on a two dimensional plane, but not if it varies.  As the later circumstance is common with organs, it is not feasible to use Mask R-CNN with a two-dimensional ROI Align for organ segmentation. As described in chapter \ref{Results}, other papers support this statement. Nevertheless, the papers also indicate potential improvement by further developing the current Mask R-CNN model. Furthermore, this thesis only uses only a limited amount of data and is bound to the implementation of Matlab. This has to be considered when evaluating the impact of this study.
