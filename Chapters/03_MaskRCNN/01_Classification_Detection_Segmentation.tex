Classification, detection and semantic segmentation are image processing tasks  that have been developed in recent years \cite{He.op.2017}\cite{Sharma.21.08.2019}\cite{.08.05.2022}:


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Classification}  is defined as the categorizing of an image to a certain category.
    
    \item \textit{Object Detection} refers to locating and classifying multiple objects within an image. The location is displayed by a squared bounding box.
    
    \item \textit{Semantic Segmentation} is a process where each pixel of an image is classified towards a certain category. This results in a pixel-based mask for each category.
    
\end{itemize}

Although image classification is able to determine the existence of an object within an image, it cannot locate it. Object Detection Models are not only able to detect multiple objects at once, but can also locate them. Nevertheless, Object Detection Models cannot determine the shape of an object. Therefore, Semantic Segmentation was introduced, classifying each pixel and hence defining the shape for each category. However, Semantic Segmentation treats all pixels of a category as one object and cannot distinguish between different instances. Instance Segmentation provides this ability to discern multiple instances of a category.
